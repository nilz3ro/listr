# `listr` 📚

## About This Project

This is a command line program written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) that can be used to manage lists.<br> It's just a toy app that I made to practice [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/).

- `remove <list>` - Remove a list, including its items.
- `add <list> <item>` - Add an item to a list.
